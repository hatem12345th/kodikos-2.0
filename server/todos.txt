1 - Set up an ASP.NET Core Project: We'll create a new ASP.NET Core project (Web API) to handle the requests.

Google OAuth and Gmail API Integration:

We need to authenticate the user's Google account to access Gmail. We'll use OAuth 2.0 and the Gmail API.

We'll set up the Gmail API to watch for new emails (using push notifications or periodically polling).

Email Processing:

When a new email arrives, we'll check if it contains an invoice (maybe by subject, sender, or attachment type).

We'll download the attachments (if any) that are images or PDFs.

OCR for Image and PDF:

For images, we can use an OCR library (like Tesseract) to extract text.

For PDFs, we might need to convert them to images first and then use OCR, or use a PDF text extraction library if the PDF is text-based.

LLM Integration:

We'll use a free LLM (like GPT-3.5-turbo or a free alternative) to parse the extracted text and structure the invoice information (like date, total amount, vendor, etc.).

Excel Generation:

We'll use a library (like EPPlus or ClosedXML) to create an Excel file and write the extracted data.

Storage:

We need to store the Excel file somewhere (like local storage or cloud storage) and possibly keep track of processed emails.

API Endpoints:

We might need an endpoint to initiate the OAuth flow and another to handle the Gmail push notifications (if using push) or a background service to poll for emails.
